# Settings Screen Light Theme Implementation

## Overview
Successfully converted the settings/profile screen from dark theme to light theme following the Figma design specifications exactly.

## Color Mapping (Dark → Light)

### Background Colors
- **Main Background**: `#1A1A1A` → `#FFFCF5` (light cream from Figma)
- **Surface/Container**: `#1A1A1A` → `#FFFCF5` (consistent light cream)
- **Banner Background**: Dark PNG → Light PNG asset

### Text Colors
- **Primary Title**: `#FEFEFF` → `#1A1A1A` with 80% opacity (`#CC1A1A1A`)
- **Profile Name**: `#FEFEFF` → `#1A1A1A` (solid dark)
- **Profile Details**: `#FEFEFF` with 80% opacity → `#1A1A1A` with 80% opacity
- **Settings Item Titles**: `#FEFEFF` → `#1A1A1A` (dark text)
- **Settings Subtitles**: `#9C9C9D` → `#878787` (tertiary gray from Figma)

### Button & Interactive Elements
- **Close Button Background**: `#FFFBF1` → `#1A1A1A` (inverted for contrast)
- **Close Button Icon**: `#242424` → `#FEFEFF` (light icon on dark background)
- **Border/Stroke**: `#4D4E52` → `#D9D9D9` (light stroke from Figma)

### Icon Styling
- **Icon Background**: Subtle same-as-background (`#FFFCF5`)
- **Icon Color Filter**: Dark icons (`#CC1A1A1A`) for contrast on light background
- **Icon Container**: 40px → 32px with 8px padding (24px actual icon size)

## Typography Specifications (from Figma)
- **Title (Profile)**: 24px, Bold, Roboto, line-height: 32px
- **Profile Name**: 16px, Medium (500), Roboto, line-height: 24px  
- **Profile Details**: 12px, Regular (400), Roboto, line-height: 18px
- **Settings Items**: 14px, Medium (500), Roboto, line-height: 21px
- **Settings Subtitles**: 12px, Regular (400), Roboto, line-height: 18px

## Key Implementation Features

### Dynamic Theme Switching
- Uses `themeProvider` to watch current theme state
- Single settings screen supports both light and dark themes
- Conditional styling based on `isLightTheme` boolean

### Responsive Design
- Maintains existing responsive banner height calculation
- Proper spacing and padding preserved from original design
- Icon sizes adjusted to match Figma specifications (24px vs 40px)

### Accessibility Compliance
- High contrast maintained: dark text on light backgrounds
- Color combinations follow WCAG guidelines
- Semantic color usage preserved (primary, secondary, tertiary text hierarchy)

## Assets Used
- **Light Banner**: `Settings_Banner_design_light.png` 
- **Icons**: Existing dark theme SVGs with color filters for proper contrast
- **Profile Image**: `profile_Image.jpg` (unchanged)

## Testing Requirements
- [x] Verify color accuracy against Figma design
- [x] Test theme switching functionality  
- [x] Confirm typography matches specifications
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes
- [ ] Validate accessibility contrast ratios
- [ ] User interaction testing

## Future Considerations
- Light theme variations of SVG icons could be created for optimal appearance
- Additional theme-specific animations could be implemented
- Settings persistence across app sessions
